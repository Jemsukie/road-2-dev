# Week 1, Day 1: üåê Overview of Web Development

## Lecture Overview:
In this session, we will introduce the basics of web development and its different components. By the end of the session, you will understand how the web works, the roles of frontend and backend development, and the essential tools you'll need.

## Key Concepts:

### 1. What is Web Development? üåç
- Web development is the process of building websites and web applications.
- It includes both **frontend development** (what the user sees) and **backend development** (how the website works behind the scenes).

### 2. Frontend vs Backend üé®üíª
- **Frontend (Client-Side):** Involves everything the user interacts with directly, like buttons, forms, images, and layouts. Technologies include:
  - **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** The structure of a webpage.
  - **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** Styles the appearance of a webpage.
  - **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.
  
- **Backend (Server-Side):** Manages how the website works, databases, and servers. Technologies include:
  - **Server-Side Languages (e.g., Node.js, Python):** Power the logic of web apps.
  - **Databases (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL):** Store information for your website.
  - **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):** Allow communication between the frontend and backend.

### 3. How Websites Work ‚öôÔ∏è
- The user's browser sends a **request** to the server for a website.
- The server responds by sending the **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** back to the browser.
- The browser then **renders** the website for the user to interact with.

### 4. The Development Workflow üîÑ
- **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** Software tools like Visual Studio Code for writing and editing code.
- **Version Control (Git):** Tracks changes in your code and allows collaboration with others.
- **Browser Developer Tools:** Useful for debugging and testing your website.

### 5. Web Development Tools üõ†
Here are some key tools that will help you as a web developer:

- **Text Editors/IDEs (Integrated Development Environment):**
  - Examples: **Visual Studio Code**, **Sublime Text**, **Atom**.
  - These are tools where you write and edit your code. They often come with useful features like syntax highlighting, debugging, and extensions for additional functionality.
  
- **Version Control:**
  - Example: **Git**, **GitHub**.
  - Helps track changes in your code and collaborate with other developers. It also allows you to revert to previous versions of your code if something goes wrong.

- **Browser Developer Tools:**
  - Every browser has built-in tools for developers to inspect HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, debug code, and monitor performance.
  - Example: **Chrome DevTools**, **Firefox Developer Tools**.
  
- **Preprocessors and Build Tools:**
  - Examples: **Sass** (for CSS), **Webpack** (for JavaScript).
  - These tools help you write more organized and maintainable code, and automate repetitive tasks like file minification, bundling, and compilation.
