## 🌐 What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of the web. It provides the structure for web pages by using elements to define different parts of the content, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

## 🏗️ Basic HTML Structure

Every HTML document follows a basic structure. Below is a simple template of an HTML page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML page!</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
</body>
</html>
```

## Breakdown of the Structure:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declares that the document is HTML5.
- `<html lang="en">`: The root element, with the language set to English.
- `<head>`: Contains meta information about the document (such as character set and title).
- `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the webpage, including text and links.

## 📄 Common HTML Elements
### Headings
HTML provides six levels of headings, from <h1> (the largest) to <h6> (the smallest).
```html
<h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is a Heading 2</h2>
```

### Paragraphs
Paragraphs are used to create blocks of text.
```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text in HTML.</p>
```

### Links
Links are created using the <a> tag, with an href attribute that defines the URL.
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link to Example</a>
```

## 🎯 Hands-On Activity: Create Your First HTML Page

### Instructions:
1. Open any text editor (such as Visual Studio Code or Notepad).
2. Copy and paste the following HTML structure into a new file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My First Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text that describes my page.</p>
    <a href="https://www.google.com">Click here to visit Google</a>
</body>
</html>
```
3. Save the file as `index.html`.
4. Open the file in a web browser by double-clicking it or dragging it into the browser window.
